We were tasked to make a workday scheduler that displays the current date at the top of the page, displays the time blocks for the standard business hours(9AM-5PM), color coded time blocks depending if it's in the past, present, or future, be able to enter and save the event. Must also be able to save the event even if the page is refreshed.

This week, I struggled on balancing homework and my life so I did not focus on styling the page. I wanted to make sure that it was functional. I was able to accomplish almost all the tasks besides the background changing depending on the time. I really struggled finding out how to use moment.js but I was happy to at least have the date displayed. 

I will most likely make this page better once I am better at JavaScript.
